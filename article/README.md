# **Building a Machine Learning API with FastAPI: Predictive Modeling for Sepsis Detection**:rocket: :hospital:

## Introduction:

In the realm of healthcare, early detection of critical conditions can significantly improve patient outcomes. In this project, we leverage machine learning to predict sepsis in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. The predictive model is exported, and a FastAPI web service is created to make real-time predictions.

## Project Overview:

### Dataset:

The dataset used in this project comprises various health-related attributes such as plasma glucose, blood pressure, and body mass index. The target variable indicates whether a patient in the ICU will develop sepsis or not.

### Machine Learning Model:

We trained a machine learning model, specifically a Gradient Boosting classifier, to predict the likelihood of sepsis based on the patient’s health parameters. The model was trained on historical data and evaluated for its predictive performance.

### Exporting the Model:

Once the model was trained and validated, we used the joblib library to export the model to a file (`your_model.joblib`). This step is crucial as it allows us to load the pre-trained model in the FastAPI application for making predictions.

### FastAPI Application:

FastAPI, a modern, fast, web framework for building APIs with Python, was chosen to serve predictions. We created a FastAPI app with a single endpoint `/predict` that accepts JSON-formatted data, converts it to a Pandas DataFrame, and uses the pre-trained model for predictions.

```python
# FastAPI code snippet
# (Assuming ‘model’ and ‘InputData’ are already defined)

@app.post('/predict')
def predict_sepsis(sepsis_features:SepsisFeatures):
    #dataframe to hold inputs
    df = pd.DataFrame([sepsis_features.model_dump()])
    
    prediction =pipeline.predict(df)
    
    ecoded_prediction= encoder.inverse_transform([prediction])[0]
    
    prediction_output ={"prediction": ecoded_prediction }
    return prediction_output
```

### Deployment:

The FastAPI application can be deployed on a server or cloud platform for real-world usage. Tools like Uvicorn and ASGI servers facilitate the deployment process. Ensure proper security measures, such as HTTPS, are in place for production deployments.

## Conclusion:

This project demonstrates the seamless integration of machine learning models with web applications using FastAPI. The predictive model, trained to detect sepsis in ICU patients, is encapsulated within a FastAPI app, providing a convenient and efficient way to make predictions in real-time.

By following this guide, you can adapt the approach to your specific use case, whether it be healthcare predictions or any other application where machine learning models can provide valuable insights.

This integration of machine learning and web development opens up possibilities for a wide range of applications, bringing the power of predictive analytics to the fingertips of developers and healthcare professionals alike.
